<strong>Why the name Grado?</strong>
Grado in Italian means Degrees. As everything in Grado is rated on an simple incremental value of 'likes' or how hot something is this seems quite fitting.

<strong>What should I share?</strong>
Grado is designed for sharing all types of great content. This includes and websites, blogs, articles, videos, pictures and even music (via Soundcloud). You could even just share a quote or a joke if you wanted.
<p>
<strong>What shouldn't I share?</strong>
Grado is not a social network. Every post is public, so keep those angry rants and selfies on Facebook. If it's something you think a stranger might like then post it!
<p>
<strong>How do I share a content</strong>
To share content open the compose view in the Grado app. Then you have two choices, share a URL. To do this simply paste in any URL. Alternatively you can add an image from your camera roll, or by capturing a new image with the camera.<p>Once you have done this you can add a comment (up to 200 characters, excluding the length of the URL) to give it some context by just typing into the same text box. Hit share and that's it! We handle all the parsing and formatting so don't worry about that!
<p>
<strong>Who can see what I post?</strong>
In short, potentially every Grado user! So If you don’t want people to see something don’t post it on Grado. But if you do you can delete it by navigating to the post in question > options > delete.

The basic concept for Grado is that content comes first. With this being the case we wanted to build something that was content driven rather than just another social network. This means you cannot 'follow' or 'friend' someone, only like their individual posts.
